# sACNtoArtNet
This is the rewritten version of the decrecated sACNtoArtNet converter. 
It is a simple python script that is not using a single class. It converts sACN (aka. ANSI E1.31) to ArtNet (and vice versa in the future)
## Please Note:
It is necessary to run Python 3.6 or later for the script to run!

# Currently working features:
